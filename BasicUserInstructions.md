# Basic User Instructions
Hello, and welcome to Read Without Me. Thanks for choosing to use my app.
Here are some quick instructions to get you started:

1. This app is Android only, so make sure you have an Android device available.
2. The app runs successfully on API levels 24 - 28.
3. You do need a working internet connection in order to sign in through Google
sign in.

## Here's How to Use the App
Read Without Me is an intuitive reading app. It's main purpose was for parents to keep track of their
children's reading habits.
1. The moment you open the app, you are greeted with Google sign in. Of course, you need a wokring
internet connection for this step.
2. The moment you sign in, you instantly a user. Of course there is a log out button if you signed in
under the wrong account.
3. Once you press the confirm button you're directed to the main book screen.
4. From here you have two choices to continue forward:
    1. You can choose a book, and go directly to the book's view to read.
    2. You can press the options menu and be given the option to go to the user info screen.
5. If you pressed a book you were directed to the view with the contents of the book. From this
screen you can read the book, which does implement a scrollable interface, there's a timer you can
see at the top, and there's an options menu with various options.
    1. If you press the play button, but timer begins. The timer is, I believe, an important function
    to this app. Next to the play button is a pause button to pause the timer.
    2. In the options menu there's a button reset the timer, there's another info option, there's a
    home option, and a quiz option.
    3. At any time in the app you are able to go home, or go to user info.
    4. Press the quiz and you will be directed to a quiz screen for the book. Immediately you'll see
    a timer at top as well, but instead this timer shows how long it took to read the book on the
    previous view. The quiz can either be general questions (meaning that the current book doesn't
    have an associated quiz) or the quiz has more content specific questions. There's a done button
    for when you finish the quiz, and an info option hidden in the options menu.
6. Pressing the done button takes you back home.
7. Pressing the info menu option directs you to the user info screen.
    1. In the user info screen you'll see all user information including your username, email, and
    the books you've read with information on how long it took you, and which user read it in a list.
    2. This list shows every user's read book on the current device. Each device could have multiple
    users associated with it, and this screen shows information for all of them, except each of their
    respective username and emails. This screen is important to know which user read which book, and
    how long it took them.
    
With all this laid out, you should have a basic understanding of how to use this app. I hope you
find it resourceful, and thanks for reading.
