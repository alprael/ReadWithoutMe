# Build Instructions
Hello, and thank you for the taking the time to check out and or work on my app.

Android builds on Java 8, make sure you have it downloaded. Here's a link to download 
[JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
This project won't work on past versions of the JDK, nor the latest versions ie (JDK 9, or 10).

Here's a link to clone the repository from Github:
```
git@github.com:alprael/ReadWithoutMe.git
```
