<h1>After the Story</h1>

<p>What a wonderful time that all was. It was super fun, I was impressed with myself, and I learned so much. What a crazy adventure.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess it's time to go home." I told myself exhaustingly.</p>
<p>I worked so hard to accomplish what I set out to do, and I did it. Home seemed to be the next great adventure of mine to impart on. Before laying down for th night, I decided to eat dinner. I'm not a good cook, so I ordered take out instead. A nice grilled chicken breast ontop of some rice and vegetables made for an incredible post evening meal.</p>
<p>As I lay down and stare at the ceiling, I can't stop thinking about how the day went and everything that occured. I don't believe it magic, but it all seemed magical to me. The places I went, and the people I met. It was all very fun and overwhelming.</p>
<p>"I don't think I've ever accomplished anything as important than this in my life." I reassurringly told myself.</p>
<p>How could I let this day end. I was a hero, and my actions mattered. Just yesterday I was sitting down watching Netflix all day. I was influential, and people looked up to me today. Like I said, it was all magical.</p>
<p>I continued to look at the ceiling...</p>
<p>Well then...</p>
<p>I guess it's time to move on. I mean, it's nice to have at least one day that's really worth living, but nothing really changed. I still have a job to go to, and family to see. The same old routine.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can consider those people my friends. They really wouldn't mind seeing me again, but am I really welcome whenever I please? They'd say yes, but would that be true? Honestly, I don't think my life could ever again be as exciting as today was.&nbsp; My entire lively hood lived out in just one day. Today is the best it probably will ever be for me.</p>
<p>And now I'm alone, at home, ready to continue on with my same, unchanged, routine of a life.</p>
<p>I lay here on my bed feeling a bit insecure, at home...with nothing to do except move on.</p>
<p>I continue to think, and think. I lay here, at home, on top of a vast planet with billions of years of development, circling around the largest star in our solar system surrounded by the vast cosmos of the expanding universe, but&nbsp;I'll keep thinking and feeling insecure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Does this all really matter? What today, yesterday or even tomorrow?"</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>"Probably not. Oh well, time to go to bed, sleep and wake up again to do the same old routine. Do as I usualy do, and live on unmeaningfully."</p>
