<p>A menacing laughter was all I could hear while looking down a corridor that lead to complete darkness. I thought about turning and running, but fear had gripped me tightly and I could barely twitch.</p>
<p>"Hello?" was probably the dumbest thing I could say, but I did anyway.</p>
<p>The laughter had stopped.</p>
<p>"How did I get here?" I thought to myself. My most recent memory up to that point was of me sitting at Starbucks enjoying a tall caramel macchiato while working on some Android development. I was so consumed in my programming that I wasn't mindful at all to my surroundings. Now I'm here, alone, in this long dark and dreary corridor.</p>
<p>That laughter had stopped, and as I stood there preoccupied in fear, there was distinct footsteps, one after another getting closer.</p>
<p>If there was a time to turn and run, it would be at that very moment, but turning around was the last thing I wanted to do. Instead I chose to face whatever it was making it's way to me.</p>
<p>The steps were long and heavy.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn't choose to face it, I had to. Just like I didn't choose to be here, but now I am. In that moment I had to take in everything one bit at a time. First the laughter, then the corridor, and now the steps.</p>
<p>"Hello?!" the second dumbest thing I could say. Demanding an answer from this thing was a thoughtful attempt, but it made no difference in the situation.</p>
<p>Yelling did give me some quick motivation to move, which I did, and turned around. That motivation quickly subsided though, when I was faced to a wall sharing the same color as the rest of the corridor. There were no windows. There were no doors. There was just me, the darkness, and whatever it was making it's way to me whose steps had now stopped.</p>
<p>Being consumed in your thoughts, work or even hobbies, can be very dangerous. We're supposed to be mindful of everything around us, and when we lose our awareness, we end up in bad situations.</p>
<p>The steps had stopped, and it was punishment that stood behind me for the simple reason of being unaware. Going from Starbucks, to a corridor. Everything inbetween was my own fault for not knowing.</p>
<p>Being so fearful, how could I turn around again? I had already made the dumb move of doing exactly that alreadly.</p>
<p>So I didn't. I stood there, and waited for something to happen. I stood there, and waited.</p>
<p>And waited...</p>
<p>And waited....</p>
<p>I closed my eyes now accepting the situation and waited.</p>
<p>And waited...</p>
<p>Then I opened my eyes and was back in Starbucks. Laptop was ahead of me, and coffee was half full. Looking around one final time, I closed my laptop, picked up my coffee, and went home.</p>
