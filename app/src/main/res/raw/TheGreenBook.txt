Green

By the best guy ever
Alex Rael


This is Jerry the gerbil and he’s green. Jerry loves to roll around.




This is JR the tiger and he’s also green. JR loves to run around.



This is Dina the bee and she is also green. Dina loves to fly around.





                                 
It doesn’t matter what color Jerry, JR, and Dina are, what matters is that they’re doing what they love, together!
